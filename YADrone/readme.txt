YADrone - Yet Another Drone Framework 
===============================================

YADrone is yet another open framework for controlling the AR.Drone 2. It is mainly based on the ARDroneForP5 project and adds some bug fixes and features. Among the changes are:

* Video support for the AR.Drone 2
* Integrated the Navdata listener from the Javadrone project to access all sensor readings
* A control center that visualizes flight behaviour and sensor readings
* Fixed the command manager so that hovering now works
* Also supports Android (but no video)

Of course, YADrone is still beta. There are some known bugs, but these mainly concern the control center and will be fixed someday soon. And YADrone is open and contributions are warmly welcome.
